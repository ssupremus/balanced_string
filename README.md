# Balanced String
This program has a `balanced?` method which takes a string as argument, validates brackets in it and returns `true` if this string is valid or `false` if it isn't.

## Usage Example
Type in terminal:
`ruby balanced.rb "({})[]"`
If you want to launch Rspec tests, run:
`bundle exec rspec -fd`
